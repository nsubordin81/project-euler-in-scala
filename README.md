# project-euler-in-scala
getting better at my favorite language by solving problems in it.

## background and purpose
I have some background with the scala programming language, from a 
coursera course taken several years ago as well as light professional
exposure on one project. I hope to use scala more in the future 
because I agree with the principles that have guided its development
and think it would be advantageous for me to use it and advocate for its
usage in my profession. So I would like to improve my understanding of
this language as well as start this round of learning off with 
a focus on scala 3 which was just released in the past year. 

So this repository will contain my efforts to solve some of the 
problems in project euler, possibly in multiple different ways
if that makes sense for the problem, but mostly this is an 
exercise for me to write code of some significance in scala.
